Udacity DAND Project Write-Up

Background
I chose to create a visualization of Baseball Test data. The data consist of the 1157 playerâ€™s detail. Their height (in
inches), weight (in pounds), average, highest run and whether they left hander, right hander or both.
Links to versions:
Version1: https://public.tableau.com/profile/amruta5126#!/vizhome/version1_5/Story1?publish=yes
With the help of given data I have done the visualization of players name with measures (avg., highest run, height,
Weight ).
Version2: https://public.tableau.com/profile/amruta5126#!/vizhome/version2_7/Story1?publish=yes
In this version I have added few more graphs in where I have done the visualization of handedness with the
measures (avg., highest run, height, weight)
Design
I chose to tell a data story using the Tableau Story tool. After doing exploratory data analysis on the dataset
Card 1:
Found the Highest Avg.
Type of chart used: Bar Graph (as they are used to compare values and in understanding the distribution of data. They can
easily summarise large data sets in a single visual)
Result: What is observed in the graph is that Bobby Mitchell has highest avg. of 0.4780
Card 2:
Tallest Player in the data
Type of chart used: Bar Graph (as they are used to compare values and in understanding the distribution of data. They can
easily summarise large data sets in a single visual)
Result: What is observed in the graph is that Dave Roberts and Jim Wright is the tallest player i.e. 150 inches
Card 3:
Heaviest Player in the data
Type of chart used: Bar Graph (as they are used to compare values and in understanding the distribution of data. They can
easily summarise large data sets in a single visual)
Result: What is observed in the graph is that Dave Roberts is the heaviest of them all around 410 pounds
Card 4:
Player with the highest run
Type of chart used: Bar Graph (as they are used to compare values and in understanding the distribution of data. They can
easily summarise large data sets in a single visual)
Result: What is observed in the graph is that Reggie Jackson has highest run of all i.e. 563
Card 5:
Avg. on the basis of handedness
Type of chart used: Bar Graph (as they are used to compare values and in understanding the distribution of data. They can
easily summarise large data sets in a single visual)
Result: What is observed in the graph is that Left hand batsmen have highest avg. compare to right handed or both
(0.328)
Card 6:
Highest run on the basis of handedness
Type of chart used: Bar Graph (as they are used to compare values and in understanding the distribution of data. They can
easily summarise large data sets in a single visual)
Result: What is observed in the graph is that Left hand batsman have highest run score compare to right handed or
both (563)
Card 7:
No. of records on the basis of handedness
Type of chart used: Bar Graph (as they are used to compare values and in understanding the distribution of data. They can
easily summarise large data sets in a single visual)
Result: What is observed in the graph is total numbers of record is highest by right handed than left handed or both
(737)
Feedback
In this project she has visualised the data basing on the handness and also basing on each player. Several traits such as the height weight etc have been measured and the batsmen who tops these lists have been noted down. A comparision between the left handed , right handed and also both has been shown.
